# Relic
---
Relic is a hybrid suite of tools with a central asset repository for digital files.

## **Mission**: Simple, unified repository
---
Relic aims to provide organzational structure and hosting of digital assets created within any software.
Specializing in consolidation of sparse abstract assets into intuitive, discoverable, relational, re-usable and practical components.

## **Organization**: Strict, unique specification
---
Relic defines categorization interactively with classification of items and their types consistently. (Ontology Semantics for computer graphics) Presented in a human-readable format for efficient machine and user exchange.

## **Orchestration**: Relic manifests itself in 3 forms
---
1. [Relic Server](h) - The communication storage hub for Relic, including the asset catalog, specification, application and plugins.
2. [Relic Application](h) - The interface for users to interact with the catalog; checking out items into local copies to utilize.
3. [Relic Plugins](h) - The extension of third-party host applications to author and operate on assets following the specification.

## What Relic is **NOT**
---
While Relic can be used for these purposes it is not built for them and will not be extended to solve their specific problems:

1. Archival or backup.
   - Does not preserve all information & metadata
2. Asset lifecycle management or version control system.
   - It's recommended to implement a dedicated service like ShotGrid. Relic will never contain features for making iterations, versions, scheduling or task assignments.
3. A scientific reference.
   - Relic's purpose is to be the best balance between as human-readablility, accuracy, usefulness and truth.
   - The repositiory will contain uncertified data, assumtions and approximations.
