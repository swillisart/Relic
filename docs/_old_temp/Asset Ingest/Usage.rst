.. note:: 
    This app does not have a quickstart.
    The initial creation of an asset is of fundamental importance for the integrity of the Library.
    The majority of it's organization and usefulness stems from this step.


Collection (Stage 1): 
----------------------
    #. Paste or type a filesystem root folder path into the text box.
    #. Press the collect button. (This only appears when a valid path has been entered.)

    This sets the stage to **Process** and starts a search herein for all :ref:`valid file types <organize-rl>`.

.. tip:: 
    You can start naming them as they appear and it will automatically update with new items as they are collected. 
    

Process (Stage 2):
---------------------
    #. Set the appropriate ingest **Category**. (This applies a category assignment when an asset is named. Subsequent assets do not need to be named under the same **Category**.)
    #. Select a single or multiple collected item in the left list. (This will also launch the :doc:`Asset Viewer </Asset Viewer/Usage>`. to inspect)
    #. Type a name to assign the Asset(s).
    #. Pressing **Enter** or **Return** in the text box assigns the name to collected item(s) selection. **Spacebar** will auto fill an existing listed name below.
    #. Pressing **Delete** will remove any collected selction(s).
    
    Repeat this process and name every asset until all have been named and moved from the collected (left) list to the processed list (right).


.. tip:: You can **Right Click** in the export list (on the right) to re-assign the proper **Category** after an item has been named.


Export (Stage 3):
---------------------
    Once all the assets have been processed. A Finish button will appear.

.. note::
    This final step may take time depending on how large the files are or how slow the filesystem access is and after ingestion has completed Assets will need to be 
    :ref:`organized <organize-rl>` and tagged within the 
    :doc:`Asset Library </Asset Library/Management>` application.
