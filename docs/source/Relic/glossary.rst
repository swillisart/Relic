~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are the secondary identifiers to define the assets parent hierarchy & categorization.
The special differences from :ref:`categories-rl` are these can be layered / nested indfinetly in parent-child relations to each other.

.. note:: These have no constraints to the hierarchal representation in the filesystem where each parent is flattened.

.. _tags-rl:

Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tags are searchable synonymic **single-word** alphanumeric names / descriptors directly related to the **individiual** asset.
They are best used as **Adjectives** and should never include any grammar, abbreviations, sentences, or slang.

Example:
Describe a dark alleyway as "sketchy" rather than "hood" because hood will show up when a user searches for jackets.
